# Theme Switching, User Filtering, and Readable Function Names

## Project Description

This project includes Python scripts that demonstrate various programming tasks related to conditional logic, list operations, and string manipulations. The project consists of several key tasks:

1. **Theme Switching**:
   - Automatically switches between light and dark themes depending on the system time or user preference.

2. **User Filtering**:
   - Finds and filters users from a list based on criteria like name and age.

3. **Function Naming Conversion**:
   - Converts function names into a readable format and displays their arguments.
